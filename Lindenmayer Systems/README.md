# Lindenmayer Systems

This program was written using the Python programming language and implements Lindenmayer Systems.

A Lindenmayer system (or L-system) is a formal grammar, which consists of an Alphabet <em>A</em>, a set of projection rules <em>P</em>, a starting axiom <em>S</em> and a set of terminals that could be translated into geometric structures. The basic idea of Lindenmayer systems is the successively rewriting of a string by replacing each nonterminal (right side of projection rules) with a new substring (left side of projection rules), which could consist of any combination of terminals and non-terminals. This refinement process makes it possible to generate very complex geometrical objects by applying simple rules to the starting axiom.
